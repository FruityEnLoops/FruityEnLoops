### hi

## Who am I?

I am FruityEnLoops, also known as blobdash. I am a student in computer science, and I like doing little projects from time to time, you can find most of them here.

[A quick access to all my socials / links](https://blobdash.carrd.co/)

To contact me, you can probably find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FruityEnLoops), or on Discord (`FruityEnLoops#6142`). For more professional inquiries, you can email me at fruityenloops (at) gmail.com.

## What do you use?

I mainly use :
- Java
- PHP
- Node, mostly for backend
- basic knowledge of Python, C and Bash

I currently use Debian 11.

## Current projects

- [IdlescapePresence](https://github.com/FruityEnLoops/IdlescapePresence) : A rich presence implementation for Idlescape, made for PreMiD. Displays your current activity, your username, your league, and your level as well as icons based on your activity, directly in Discord.
- [HoursAndCounting-js](https://github.com/FruityEnLoops/HoursAndCounting-js) : A discord bot to display schedules. It was a project I made for my DUT's Discord server, to let users with different groups to easily see their schedules and their friend's schedules without having to navigate the outdated and slow website made for our time tables. This is a rewrite of [HoursAndCounting](https://github.com/FruityEnLoops/HoursAndCounting), which was written in Java. I wanted to have a more flexible (and clean) code base, so I started from scratch.

## Personal interests

- Music. I listen to music pretty much all the time, as you can see on my [last.fm account](https://www.last.fm/user/blobdash). I listen to some weird stuff, you're warned. I also create music, available on most streaming services and my [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/blobdash) and [Bandcamp](https://blobdash.bandcamp.com/).

- Games. I play mostly rhythm games, such as [beatoraja](https://github.com/exch-bms2/beatoraja/). I also play FPS games like Apex Legends, Call of Duty (mostly zombies, let's be honest) and the other classic ones.

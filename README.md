### hi

## Who am I?

I am FruityEnLoops, also known as blobdash. I am currently studying at Lille's IUT A, and I like doing little projects from time to time, you can find most of them here. You can also find [my dotfiles and various scripts](https://github.com/FruityEnLoops/scripts) in my scripts repository.

[A quick access to all my socials / links](https://blobdash.carrd.co/)

To contact me, you can probably find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FruityEnLoops), or on Discord (`FruityEnLoops#6142`). For more professional inquiries, you can email me at fruityenloops (at) gmail.com.

## What do you use?

I mainly use :
- Java
- J2EE

but I also have basic knowledge of Python, C, Bash for scripting, Typescript / Javascript and web languages.

I run Linux on my laptop for schoolwork and love it. I still can't get away from Windows for my more "gaming" setup, but if I could, I would.

My laptop currently runs Fedora.

## Current projects

- [IdlescapePresence](https://github.com/FruityEnLoops/IdlescapePresence) : A rich presence implementation for Idlescape, made for PreMiD. Displays your current activity, your username, your league, and your level as well as icons based on your activity, directly in Discord.
- [HoursAndCounting](https://github.com/FruityEnLoops/HoursAndCounting) : A discord bot to display schedules. It was a project I made for my DUT's Discord server, to let users with different groups to easily see their schedules and their friend's schedules without having to navigate the outdated and slow website made for our time tables.
- [TimeRunner](https://github.com/FruityEnLoops/TimeRunner) : A basic timer for tasks, which lets you see tasks in a more graphic way, made with JavaFX as a school project.

## Personal interests

- Music. I listen to music pretty much all the time, as you can see on my [last.fm account](https://www.last.fm/user/blobdash). I listen to japanese doujin music, french rap, and a lot of other stuff. I also create music, available on most streaming services and my [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/blobdash) and [Bandcamp](https://blobdash.bandcamp.com/).

- Games. I play mostly rhythm games, such as [beatoraja](https://github.com/exch-bms2/beatoraja/). I also am interested in arcade rhythm games, which are sadly very niche in France. I also play FPS games like Call of Duty or Counter Strike, and I like to try out new games, even if they're not my usual kind of games.
